## Description

_The following document contains a Track Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future coding students a series of questions about themselves and provides a track suggestion based on their answers._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Close this repository._
* _Open terminal, navigate to the project directory, run command "open index.html" in terminal._

## Known Bugs

_Not all combinations work because certain preferences aren't compatible. For instance, someone who says they would prefer "back-end" but would like to work on "interfaces" would not get a result because those didn't seem very compatible._
